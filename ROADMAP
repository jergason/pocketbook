##File Upload

* Multiple file upload
  * This means the files should be uploaded into their own
    directory, and the whole directory should be passed as the
    file path to the file upload method.
* Users should upload using their own tranche user
  * Add tranche username and password to the User model?
  * Make it default to using the pocketbook username and password?
  * Radio button in the user account page for determining whether they
    want to use the pocketbook tranche account or their own credentials?
  * Where to put the constants for the site tranche user credentials?
* Better error handling
  * If it is an authentication error, have them check their credentials
    and offer to just use the default pocketbook account.
* Automated way to test file upload, and then mark for deletion.
  Look at selenium maybe?

##File Download

* Make tranche hash link to the java downloader?
  * This is harder than it sounds, because the hash is in no way related
    to the link to download the file. The link is in the form of
    
* Do we split the download into a separate process? Use delayed job? how?

##Search

* Look at solr configuration.


##Questions for presentation:

* How to handle errors in uploading if we are using delayed_job?
* How to handle tranche authentication? We would need to store their password
  in plain text in the database in order for it to work. Also, would be a
  little annoying to have two separate authentication schemes, one for pocketbook
  and one for tranche.
  * Should the default be to use pocketbook? Radio button, when they want to
    use their own authentication they select the button and something pops
    out to enter it?
